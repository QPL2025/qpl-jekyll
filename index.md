![Varna](images/varna.jpeg "Varna, Bulgaria")

The **22nd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2025)**
will take place from 14 July to 18 July 2025 in Varna, Bulgaria.  Quantum
Physics and Logic is an annual conference that brings together academic and
industry researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum
computation, quantum physics, and related areas. The main focus is on the use
of algebraic and categorical structures, formal languages, type systems,
logics, semantic methods, as well as other mathematical and computer scientific
techniques applicable to the study of physical systems, physical processes, and
their composition. Work applying quantum-inspired techniques and structures to
other fields, such as linguistics, artificial intelligence, and causality, is
also welcome.


### Important Dates

* Abstract submission deadline: 9 February 2025
* Paper submission deadline: 16 February 2025
* Notification: 24 March 2025
* Camera-ready deadline (revised accepted proceedings manuscripts): 15 June 2025
* Conference: 14 July -- 18 July 2025

All deadlines are stated with respect to the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe).


### Submissions

Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the following:

* **Proceedings submission.** This consists of a 5-12 page paper. It must
  provide sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest, in sufficient
  detail for the program committee to assess the merits of the work.
  Proceedings submissions must use
  the [EPTCS style files](https://style.eptcs.org/).
* **Talk proposal.** This consists of a 3 page summary, together with
  a link to a separate published paper or preprint. If the published paper or
  preprint is not publicly available (e.g. not open access), then it should be
  included in full after the summary.
* **Poster submission.** This consists of a 3 page summary of partial results or
  work in progress.

Page limits exclude bibliography and appendices (which may be read at the
discretion of reviewers). All submissions will be handled by EasyChair (link
TBA).

There will be an award for Best Student Paper that will be determined by the
Program Committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the
authors are students at the time of submission.

### Registration

Registration is not open yet.

### Presentations

Authors of accepted proceedings and non-proceedings submissions will be invited
to give a talk. Authors of accepted poster submissions will be invited to present
their work at the poster session.

The conference program will be announced later.

### Conference Proceedings

Conference proceedings will be published in [Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS)](https://about.eptcs.org/) after the
conference. When preparing the final version for publication, authors of
accepted proceedings submissions are allowed to use up to three extra pages
(i.e. up to 15 pages excluding bibliography) to address reviewer concerns and
suggestions under the provisio that they do not introduce new results.

### Local Information

The conference will take place at the [Rosslyn Dimyat Hotel](https://dimyat.rosslyn-hotels.com/page/hotel) in Varna, Bulgaria.
