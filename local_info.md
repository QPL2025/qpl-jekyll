The conference will take place at the [Hotel Cherno More](https://www.chernomorebg.com/en/index.html) in [Varna](https://visit.varna.bg/en/index.html), Bulgaria.

{% include map.html id="location" title="Conference Location" %}

During the summer season, Varna becomes a busy tourist destination and finding accommodation may get difficult. We therefore advise booking your stay as early as possible. In general, we recommend booking accommodation in the city centre, or close to the sea in walking distance from the conference venue. 
  
We have negotiated discounted prices for QPL participants at the hotels listed below. Prices are given in Bulgarian lev, or BGN, where 1 EUR = 1.9558 BGN.

**Classic room**: single occupancy 158 BGN, double occupancy 185 BGN.  
**Delux room**: single occupancy 194 BGN, double occupancy 221 BGN (here, a third person could be added for an extra 50 BGN).  
**Exclusive room**: single occupancy 221 BGN, double occupancy 248 BGN.  

These prices include breakfast. You can get more information and make a booking using the codes below on the hotel website.

Rooms can be booked at the above rates for any duration in the period 13 – 19 July, conditional on availability, using the **bonus code**: QPL25. 

In order to ensure some availability, 10 rooms of type Twin Classic (with two separate beds that could be brought next to each other if desired) and 20 rooms of type Twin Delux (with two separate beds that could be brought next each other if desired) have been blocked until 30 April for booking by QPL participants. They can be booked using the **block code** QPL25TCLS for a Twin Classic room, and the **block code** QPL25TDLX for a Twin Deluxe room. Each of these rooms can be reserved for single or double occupancy, and in the case of Twin Deluxe, a third person can be added.

If any of the blocked rooms have not been booked by 30 April, they will be open for booking by anyone, but QPL participants could still book them at the reduced prices with the bonus code QPL25 provided there is availability. Feel free to write to the hotel with further inquiries.
